# tkinter-calculator
Basic calculator app made using Tkinter as part of Replit's 100 days of Python coding challenge

This was my first time building a GUI with Tkinter and I learnt how to use the button widget to create clickable buttons, use the .grid() Geometry Manager, and use the label widget to display text

The calculator can perform the basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
